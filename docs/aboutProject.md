# About project

Project main goal is to provide way to backup files in different kind of clouds services. We probably will need this
to backup our files and pictures from @phpers meetings.

Very important to us as developers to show that in well desgined application, frameworks and databases (persistence layer)
are just implementation details.

In [this repo](https://github.com/cocoders/FileArchiveSymfony) you can see how to integrate this application into framework like Symfony2.
